# Python Best Practices

This document contains information about Python best practices and conventions.

## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task
- Write docstrings for modules, classes, and functions

## Project Structure

- Organize code into modules and packages
- Use `__init__.py` to define package interfaces
- Keep configuration separate from code
- Use virtual environments to manage dependencies

## Error Handling

- Use specific exception types rather than bare `except:`
- Handle exceptions at the appropriate level
- Log errors with context for debugging
- Fail fast and provide clear error messages

## Testing

- Write unit tests for core functionality
- Use pytest for test organization
- Aim for good test coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions
